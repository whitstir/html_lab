		<p>Brass instruments can easily be distinguishable from woodwinds through a few specific ways. To begin, brass instruments are, well, made out of brass or another type of metal. Yes, I know you're probably thinking, "Well that saxophone instrument I just read about looks like it's made out of metal!" Well you're absolutely right, but that's becuase the saxophone just felt like it had to  be different. In most cases, only brass instruments will be the ones made out of metal. </p>	
		<p>In addition to this, brass instruments also have what are called valves. Woodwinds tend to have holes on their bodies that the musician's fingers press over to cover, however brass instruments have no such holes. These valves are pushed by the musician to change the length of the tubing that the sound will travel through, resulting in either higher or lower pitches.</p>
		<p>Brass instruments also create their sound in a much different way compared to woodwind instruments. Instead of blowing on an expensive piece of wood, brass players buzz their lips against the mouthpiece to create vibrations while blowing air. The size of the hole the player makes with their lips will also have an effect on the resulting pitch of the sound. For this reason, brass instruments don't have to deal with a million different keys and holes to keep track of like the woodwinds. One valve position could play many different notes depending on how open the player's mouth is. </p>
