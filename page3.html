			<p>The flute has been around for thousands of years, being mentioned from Greek mythology all the way up to the present. It has wiggled its way into storybooks, art, music, and the lives of millions of people throughout the world. In some areas, flutes are still made out of wood, or have a simliar look to the recorder. However, in an ensemble setting, the flute category provides the soprano voices, and are also unique in their vibrato capabilities.  </p>
			<h2>Flute Instruments</h2>
			<p>Instead of having a mouthpiece and reed, flute instruments have what is known as a headjoint. This headjoint has a singular hole through which the player blows air. When the air hits the sharp edge of the flute, the air is directed inwards and vibrates, creating the beautiful flute sound. Typically, two kinds of flutes can be found in a band: the flute and the piccolo. </p>
