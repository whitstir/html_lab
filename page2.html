		  <p>The bare minimum that one must know to call themselves "educated" in the components of a band all begins with the instruments. There are a wide variety of instruments in a band, consisting of woodwinds, brass, and occasionally stringed instruments as well (keep in mind, this does not automatically classify a band as an orchestra, get it right.) Woodwinds often carry many of the melodic and lyrical phrases with a band, and are one of the most important components to a good sound. </p>
			
		  <p>Originally, the woodwind instruments were much easier to differentiate from others, specifically due to one feature. And what would these special feature be? You guessed it. They were made out of wood. Before metal and plastic instruments gained popularity in the modern era, instruments such as the flute and clarinet were wooden poles with holes. Kind of funny how that rhymes huh? However, the definition of a woodwind instrument has now changed to be more inclusive to instruments such as the saxophone, which has never really been made out of wood. Now, a woodwind is basically any instrument that consists of a wood, plastic, or metal cylindrical body with holes. Many of these holes are either covered by a button when pressed, or sometimes are even covered by the fingers themselves. One category of woodwind instruments is the reed instruments. </p>
			<h2>Reed Instruments.</h2>
			<p>A reed is a piece of wood that when blowed upon, vibrates. This vibration produces the clear tone of these wind instruments, mainly consisting of the clarinet, oboe, saxophone, and bassoon. A ligature, typically an adjustable metal or leather band, is used to secure the reed to the mouthpiece of the instrument in order to ensure the purest sound.</p>
